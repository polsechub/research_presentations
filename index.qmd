**Implications**

-   Feeling of insecurity key in whether or not people support/trust peacekeepers deployed in their area

**Questions**

-   Are we likely to find local support for peacekeepers wane as post-conflict societies become more peaceful and economically prosperous?

-   May be policymakers should strive to foster more support towards local institutions like policy and military; and that waning support towards peacekeepers is a good thing?
