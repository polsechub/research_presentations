## The Project {.centit}

-   A part of a larger research project on Maritime crime & security
-   Collaboration between UT, Knoxville & UNCW
-   Funded by Office of Naval Research (Minerva Research Initiative), 2020-2023

## Project Outputs at various stages {.smaller}

**Media & Blogs**

\(2021\) "Fights over Maritime Boundaries are Creating Safe Zones for Pirates." *The Monkey Cage, Washington Post*

\(2021\) "How History Predicts COVID-19's Impact on Maritime Piracy." *Homeland Security Today*

## Background

-   Piracy is costly
-   International Maritime Bureau estimates: \$1-9 bn/year
-   UNODC, report by *Stable Seas* 2021, piracy costs in the Gulf of Guinea region
    -   Direct costs (Ransom paid, losses from stolen oil and goods, spending on counter piracy efforts, prosecutions and legal effort): \$200-300 million per year
-   What about indirect costs on trade? <!-- - More salient question after the recent supply-chain problem & its effect on trade disruption -->

## Research Question

-   Indirect consequences of maritime piracy

-   How does maritime piracy influence international trade (narrower: vessel traffic) ?

## Indirect costs of piracy?

-   Most accounts of estimates anecdotal & "guesstimate" mainly due to lack of data

-   But the availability of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data can be immensely helpful

    -   For instance, recent work by economists Sandkamp, Stamer & Yang (2021): daily ship data

    -   We build on this work by using more fine-grained 2-hourly data to understand ship traffic behavior in the event of piracy

    -   Work in progress!

## Piracy & Trade

-   The problem of piracy peaked after mid-2000s
-   Mainly driven by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden

## Piracy & Trade

-   The problem of piracy peaked after mid-2000s
-   Mainly driven by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden
-   International efforts to tackle piracy lowered
-   But increasing in other parts of the world
-   Piracy should lead to disruption and delays in trade, as ships wait for the problem to avert or re-route utilizing safer spaces

*H1: Piracy incidents in an area should lead to lower vessel traffic movement at the local level*

## Empirical Strategy

-   Focus on the Gulf of Guinea (Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Cameroon, Ghana, Ivory Coast)

-   Utilize two main datasets at this stage:

    -   Dataset on Maritime Piracy
    -   Vessel traffic

## Maritime piracy dataset

-   Build original Maritime Piracy Event & Location Dataset (1990-2019)
    -   Triangulating from three sources:
        -   International Maritime Bureau (IMB),
        -   International Maritime Organization (IMO) and\
        -   Anti-shipping Activity Messages (ASAM)

## Vessel Traffic dataset

-   Satellite and terrestrial AIS data, tracking all ships 300 gross tonnage and upwards engaged on international voyages (of 500 GT and up if not engaged in international voyages)
    -   Proprietary data provided for research by Fleetmon
        -   2-hour time-stamp
        -   Destination/flags
        -   Types of ship

## Eyeballing the data

-   Do we see piracy in the grid-cell disrupt the vessel traffic?

## Model: Fixed effect estimator (two-way)

</br>

</br>

$$ \Delta Y_{it} = \beta\Delta Piracy_{it} +\alpha_{i} +\mu_{t}+\Delta U_{it} $$ Where, $i$ is for grid-cell and $t$ is month, and $\Delta Y_{it}$ is the change in vessel traffic in log form, as explained by $\Delta Piracy_{it}$

## 

-   In the above, we focus on "all" vessel types
-   If piracy affects trade, we should see enhanced effect on "Cargo" and "Oil Tankers"

## More questions

-   Do we find the ripple effect beyond the grid-cell?
-   How does this translate into actual cost of disruption to trade?
